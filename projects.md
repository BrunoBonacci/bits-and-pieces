Here some of my Open Source projects which you might be interested into.


### Samsara


Samsara is a Real-Time analytics platform written in Clojure.

It's is a large scale analytics platform for BigData. With this
project I'm targeting users who feel the need of data analytics and
they want to keep their data, as supposed to use a third-party service
which it just shows you aggregated reports and not the raw data.

It can be used on both: website and mobile apps, but also in backend
services.  Samsara provides a end-to-end solution for collecting,
ingesting, processing, enrich, query and visualize your data leveraging
well established Open Source solutions like Kafka and ElasticSearch.

It has been used in large scale deployments processing _over 685
million events per day, and 25 million events per hour in peak time,
and over 500K clients_.

Because of it's flexible and scalable processing system you can build
easily real-time solutions for your products/services.  I've used it
to build a real-time recommendation system and other machine learning
solutions.

I'm looking to expand this project with more out-of-the-box machine
learning modules and to create a community behind the project.
