I'm a BigData Architect interested in high volume, high availability, low latency systems, Cloud and BigData technologies.
I've over 20 years of commercial experience working with small startups and large corporates. I do enjoy technical challenges and working among teams of passionate people.
Those days I'm mostly hacking on Clojure, Groovy, Hadoop, Storm, Cascalog, MongoDB, Cassandra building real-time analytics.
