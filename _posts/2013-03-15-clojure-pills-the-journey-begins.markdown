Few months back, after reading an inspiring post about Lisp and the agility of developing new ideas, I decided to start my journey and learn Clojure.

Here Iâ€™m describing my personal Clojure exploration with small posts, bigger than a tweet, but smaller than a blog post, so that the reader can grasp the concept in a couple of minutes and move on. The format that I will use for those posts is the micro-blog. On each post I will try to describe an aspect of Clojure with some code examples.

The idea is to cover the whole language and parts of the ecosystem with lots of very small posts, so that my journey in Clojure-land can be useful to someone else.

Therefore, like every journey, this project begins with this first step.
