Often while exploring a new dataset in Clojure I use the excellent
[Incanter](http://incanter.org/) library.
Incanter is a `R`-like platform for statistical analysis written
in Clojure.

Now Clojure, on its own, is very powerful and very well suited
to process and transform data as
[it includes a large number of data-processing functions on its core](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html).

Incanter combines the power and flexibility of Clojure with
[a number of ready-to-use statistical functions](http://incanter.github.io/incanter/stats-api.html)
and a simple way to plot charts using
[JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/).
[Emacs + CIDER](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/1/28/state-of-clojure-2015-survey-results)
is the primary development IDE in Clojure-land, and if you have done
any development at all in Clojure, the idiomatic way to do it is via
[REPL](http://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main) interaction.

So following the
[Incanter's Getting Started guide](https://github.com/incanter/incanter/wiki#getting-started-with-incanter)
you can create a project and fire up a REPL with Emacs with the following
steps:

``` bash
lein new try-incanter
```

Then open the `try-incanter/project.clj` file and add the Incanter dependency:

``` clojure
(defproject try-incanter "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]
                 [incanter "1.5.6"] ;; just added incanter dep
                 ])
```

Now you are ready to start the Clojure's REPL with `C-c M-j` (or `M-x cider-jack-in`).

Once the REPL is ready a buffer will popup with the following content:

``` clojure
;; Connected to nREPL server running on port 59077 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:59077
;; CIDER 0.11.0 (Bulgaria), nREPL 0.2.12
;; Clojure 1.7.0, Java 1.8.0_45
;;     Docs: (doc function-name)
;;           (find-doc part-of-name)
;;   Source: (source function-name)
;;  Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class)
;;     Exit: C-c C-q
;;  Results: Stored in vars *1, *2, *3, an exception in *e;
;; ======================================================================
user>
```

At this point you are ready to hack on your data.
For example open the file `src/try_incanter/core.clj` and require a few Incanter's namespaces and let's plot something:

``` clojure
(ns try-incanter.core
  (:require [incanter.core :as i]
            [incanter.stats :as s]
            [incanter.charts :as p]))

(i/view (p/histogram (s/sample-normal 1000)))
```

If you evaluate this buffer with `C-c C-k` it will create a new window
on your desktop with a chart which looks as follow:

![normal-distribution](/images/20160318_histogram.png)

Annoyingly this popup (on a Mac) appears in the background, so you
have to look for it and after a number of chart-plotting-steps your
desktop might look just like this:

![messy desktop](/images/20160318_messy_desktop.png)

The continuous swapping between windows is irritating because you lose
the _REPL-momentum_.  One of the advantages of working with Emacs is
that it is extensible in ways no other IDE system is. What I wanted
was to be able to plot a Incanter chart and see the result directly in
Emacs.

To achieve this, the first step is to render the chart into an image
and save it into a file. Add the following lines in your
`src/try_incanter/core.clj` and evaluate it (`C-c C-c`).

``` clojure
(defn show [chart]
  "Renders a chart and saves the result in a temp file"
  (i/save chart "/tmp/chart.png" :width 700 :height 500))
```

If we replace the `i/view` function with our own `show` function,
rather than creating a new popup, a file will be created in your temp
folder called `/tmp/chart.png`.

``` clojure
;; before
;; (i/view (p/histogram (s/sample-normal 1000)))

;; after: note we just replaced `view` with `show`
(show (p/histogram (s/sample-normal 1000)))
```

To be able to see image we need to hack a bit on Emacs.  Open your
`*scratch*` buffer (or your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file) and add the
following lines.

``` elisp
;;
;; Incanter eval and display chart
;;

(require 'cider)
(setq incanter-temp-chart-file "/tmp/chart.png")
(setq incanter-wait-time 500)


(defun incanter-display-image-inline (buffer-name file-name)
  "Use `BUFFER-NAME' to display the image in `FILE-NAME'.
  Checks weather `BUFFER-NAME' already exists, and if not create
  as needed."
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window buffer-name)
  (iimage-mode t)
  (read-only-mode -1)
  (kill-region (point-min) (point-max))
  ;; unless we clear the cache, the same cached image will
  ;; always get re-displayed.
  (clear-image-cache nil)
  (insert-image (create-image file-name))
  (read-only-mode t))

(defun incanter-eval-and-display-chart ()
  "Evaluate the expression preceding point
   and display the chart into a popup buffer"
  (interactive)
  (let ((old-buf (current-buffer)))
    (condition-case nil
                    (delete-file incanter-temp-chart-file)
                    (error nil))
    (cider-eval-last-sexp)
    (sleep-for 0 incanter-wait-time)
    (incanter-display-image-inline "*incanter-chart*" incanter-temp-chart-file)
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window old-buf)))

(define-key cider-mode-map
    (kbd "C-c C-i") #'incanter-eval-and-display-chart)
```

Here it's where the magic happens. Evaluate this buffer with `C-c C-b`
(or `M-x eval-buffer`) and go back to your Clojure file
`src/try_incanter/core.clj`.  By pressing `C-c C-i` at the end of the
following like a new buffer with the resulting image should be visible
directly inside your Emacs.

``` clojure
(show (p/histogram (s/sample-normal 1000)))
```

![emacs incanter](/images/20160318_emacs_incanter_hack.png)

No more annoying windows appearing, no more switching,
you can code and explore your dataset directly from Emacs.

## Conclusions

This solution isn't certainly a "clean" solution but just a "hack" to
make my daily working routine with Incanter running a little smoother.

There are several other solution which I've also tried before hacking
this one. I've used the excellent
[Yeldbot Vizard](https://github.com/yieldbot/vizard) plotting library
which I particularly like for its simplicity and easy REPL
integration, however the number of supported charts is still quite
small and it requires to transform the dataset from the Incanter
format to the format it expects.

The other solution I've tried is the
[Gorilla REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/) which is a *iNotebook*-like
REPL for Clojure. Again pretty nice solution, but it doesn't have the
full power of Emacs and CIDER.  If your are predominantly
developing in Emacs you probably don't want to move out of Emacs but
you are going to try to bring everything else into Emacs.

My Emacs-lisp knowledge is still very poor so maybe there
are better ways to do the same thing and I invite the more experienced Emacs
hackers to leave a comment and suggest alternative solutions.

For example my first attempt was to render the plotted chart to a file
and open the file directly in Emacs. Because I have the
`global-auto-revert-mode` enabled, I was expecting that upon a image
update, the auto-revert would have kicked in and the new image
displayed; however what actually happens is that the image disappears
and the binary content of the new image is displayed instead.

Happy hacking to everyone.
